# Moo - the best new twitter replacement around!
###### not really

## What is Moo?
I made Moo as a challenge to myself to make a twitter-like web app in a short amount of time. So, when I sat down on the train one morning about half way through the hour-long trip, I began said project. I continued the project on my way home that same day and this is the result.

## What did I use?
This project was made with
 - `Ruby 2.5.1p57`
 - `Rails 5.2.1`
 
 I also made use of `rails generate scaffold` to make it as quickly as possible, so it's rather a dirty job.
